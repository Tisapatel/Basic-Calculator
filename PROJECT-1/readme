
# Basic Calculator Web Application

This is a simple web-based calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculation.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
calculator.html        -> Main HTML file for the calculator interface
style.css              -> Contains styling rules for the calculator layout (if external)
script.js              -> JavaScript functionality for performing operations (if external)
bg-image.jpg           -> Optional background image (for styling)
```

## 💡 Features

- **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Percentage** calculations
- User-friendly and responsive UI
- Clear button to reset all inputs
- Input validation to prevent invalid operations (like division by zero)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## 📋 Instructions

1. Open `calculator.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter values in the "First Number" and "Second Number" input fields.
3. Click on the desired operation button (+, -, *, /, %) to see the result.
4. Use the "Clear" button to reset all inputs.

## 🚨 Validation Rules

- Ensures both inputs are numbers (except when using the percentage button, which uses only the first input).
- Alerts if fields are empty or if invalid operations (e.g., divide by zero) are attempted.

## 🧠 Author Notes

This project is great for beginners looking to understand basic web development, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI behavior using vanilla JavaScript.
